# About
Web Stats compiles online resources in the areas of Statistics, Experimental Design, Machine Learning, Big Data, and Bioinformatics. For the moment, it works as a repository of materials I use in my work and often recommend or discuss with others. As time permits, I will upload further material prepared by myself as well as new resources that may come my way. 

In addition, there are links to scientific papers and outreach materials that I find relevant.
