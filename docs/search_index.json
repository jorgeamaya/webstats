Integrative Life Sciences 2022-09-26 Chapter 1 About This site compiles online resources in the areas of Experimental Design, Machine Learning, and Bioinformatics. For the moment, it works as a repository of materials I use in my own work and often recommend or discuss with others. In addition, there are links to scientific papers and outreach materials that I find relevant. "],["statistics-and-experimental-design.html", "Chapter 2 Statistics and Experimental Design 2.1 General material 2.2 Experimental Design 2.3 Advanced material", " Chapter 2 Statistics and Experimental Design This page collects useful resources in experimental design - mostly Analysis of Variance and it’s variations and Regression Methods - that, in my opinion, are enough to get most peoples project up and running on the statistical front. Most of this resources assume previous exposure in some way or another to statistics, Linux, R, and Python, so they may not be the most appropriate resources for beginners. In any case, if you’re a beginner and you still want to use this resources, my advice is to start with Advanced Statistics written by Zhiyong Johnny Zhang and Lijuan Peggy Wang. 2.1 General material Advanced Statistics written by Zhiyong Johnny Zhang and Lijuan Peggy Wang. The statistics book of the Advance Statistics course at the University of Notre Dame. Contrary to what the name seems to indicate, this book, specially the first chapters, are accesible to anyone with little knowledged of statistic or R. A good place to start. 2.2 Experimental Design Comparing Means in R. An online course covering most of what needs to be know about Analysis of Variance for Parametric and Non-parametric scenarios. In other words, ANOVA and all its different flavors… To navigate the website, go to the Lessons sections and pick the topic of interest. STAT 501: Regression Methods. The Regression Methods course of PennState, part of their Master in Applied Statistics. Covers, effectively, most topics in Regression, from Simple Linear Regression to Multiple Linear Regression. It also contains a primer on Times Series and other types of Regression like Logistic, Poisson, and Non Linear Regression. 2.3 Advanced material Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats) and Common statistical tests are linear models: a work through. Excellent resources that proves the power of Regression Methods and how most experimental designs are Regression.

Focus is given to material that have an applied focus rather than a theoretical one. For more theoretical materials, go to the Basic Mathematics section. Cluster Analysis in R: Practical Guide. A compilation of clustering methods in R including some of the conceptual background that underpin them.
