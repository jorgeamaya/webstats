For the moment, it works as a repository of materials I use in my own work and often recommend or discuss with others. As time permits, I will upload further material prepared by myself as well as new furthers resources that may come my way. In addition, there are links to scientific papers and outreach materials that I find relevant. Contact Details: Email: j.e.amaya.romero@rug.nl. GitHub: https://github.com/jorgeamaya. "],["statistics-and-experimental-design.html", "Chapter 2 Statistics and Experimental Design 2.1 General material 2.2 Experimental Design 2.3 Advanced material", " Chapter 2 Statistics and Experimental Design This section collects useful resources in Experimental Design that are enough to get most people’s project up and running on the statistical front. These materials cover, first, Analysis of Variance and its many parametric and non-parametric variations and, second, Regression Methods. Most of this resources assume previous exposure to statistics, Linux, R, and Python. They may not be the most appropriate material for beginners. In any case, if you’re a beginner and you still want to use these resources, my advice is to start with Advanced Statistics written by Zhiyong Johnny Zhang and Lijuan Peggy Wang. 2.1 General material Advanced Statistics written by Zhiyong Johnny Zhang and Lijuan Peggy Wang. The statistics book of the Advance Statistics course at the University of Notre Dame. Contrary to what the name seems to indicate, this book, specially the first chapters, are accessible to anyone with little knowledge of statistic or R. A good place to start. 2.2 Experimental Design Comparing Means in R. An online course covering most of what needs to be know about Analysis of Variance for Parametric and Non-parametric scenarios. In other words, ANOVA and all its different flavors… To navigate the website, go to the Lessons sections and pick the topic of interest. STAT 501: Regression Methods. The Regression Methods course of Penn State, part of their Master in Applied Statistics. It covers most relevant topics on Regression, from Simple Linear Regression to Multiple Linear Regression. It also contains a primer on Times Series and other types of Regression like Logistic, Poisson, and Non Linear Regression. STAT 504: Analysis of Discrete Data. This course also from Penn State’s master in Applied Statistics covers methods for the analysis of discrete and categorical data. These are more specialized analyses and biologist are less likely to find them in their day to day, but it’s still a good resource to keep in store. STAT 501: Regression Methods is a pre-requisite to go through this material. 2.3 Advanced material Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats) and Common statistical tests are linear models: a work through. Excellent resources that prove the power of Regression Methods and how most experimental designs are, at the end of day, Regressions. Advanced Regression Methods. The syllabus of the Advanced Regression Methods course at the University of Alabama. This material cover more advanced regression methods not covered in the Penn State courses including Curvilinear Regressions methods, Multi-level models, Growth Models, Binary Logistic Regression, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Ordinal Logistics Regression, and Probit Analysis.

Focus is given to material that have an applied focus rather than a theoretical one. For more theoretical materials, go to the Basic Mathematics section. 3.1 Data Exploration Pandas Profiling. A Python Library that automatizes the production of summary statistics from pandas data frames, similar to the summary() function in R, but with more output. Good for data exploration before running further analysis. Source code available here. Further examples here. 3.2 Clustering Methods Cluster Analysis in R: Practical Guide. A compilation of clustering methods in R including some of the conceptual background that underpin them. 3.3 Correlation Methods At surface level, determining the correlation between data points is a simple procedure, yet it’s still a great part of performing analyses on big data sets. That being said, calculating and visualizing the correlations in large multidimensional data sets is not trivial. For this reason, I decided to create a separate section with techniques to calculate correlations. An Alternative to the Correlation Coefficient That Works For Numeric and Categorical Variables. s-Corrplot. The s-CorrPlot is a scatterplot for visually exploring pairwise correlation coefficients between multiple variables in large datasets. Running Correlations in R. A chapter on correlation from the Advanced Regression Methods course from the University of Alabama already mentioned in the Statistics and Experimental Design section. It covers “classical” correlation methods like Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlations, and more niche methods like Point Biserial Correlation, Phi Correlation, Partial and Semipartial Correlation. "],["bioinformatics-workflows.html", "Chapter 4 Bioinformatics Workflows 4.1 Workflows 4.2 Practical resources", " Chapter 4 Bioinformatics Workflows This page compiles some common bioinformatic workflows any person working with NGS is likely to perform at some point. Special focus is giving to aligning sequences to a reference genome and doing the variant calling. 4.1 Workflows Variant Calling Workflow - From reads to short variants. RNA-Seq Analyses. Data Wrangling and Processing for Genomics. How to use command-line tools to perform quality control, align reads to a reference genome, and identify and visualize between-sample variation. Part of a more comprehensive workshop on genomics that assumes no previous knowledge of the command line. 4.2 Practical resources How to structure a Bioinformatic Project. My class on How to structure a Bioinformatic Project for the “Programming for Biology” course at the University of Groningen. "],["basic-mathematics.html", "Chapter 5 Basic Mathematics", " Chapter 5 Basic Mathematics This section cover some of the basic math that is necessary to understand Machine Learning Algorithms. Paul’s Online Notes. Online notes prepared by Paul Dawkins from Lamar University. The material cover Linear Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus, and Differential Equations. Linear Algebra Cheat Sheet. The Magic of Machine Learning: Gradient Descent Explained Simply but With All Math. Gradient descent is the most common optimization algorithm used in Machine Learning methods, including Neural Networks. Any person wanting to understand and perform ML must have a basic understanding of this algorithm, even if just to chose a different optimization technique. This article covers the math behind the Gradient Descent algorithm without being overwhelming. Some basic understanding of Linear Algebra is necessary.
