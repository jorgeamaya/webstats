Special focus is given to aligning sequences to a reference genome and doing the variant calling. 4.1 Workflows Variant Calling Workflow - From reads to short variants. RNA-Seq Analyses. Data Wrangling and Processing for Genomics. How to use command-line tools to perform quality control, align reads to a reference genome, and identify and visualize between-sample variation. Part of a more comprehensive workshop on genomics that assumes no previous knowledge of the command line. 4.2 Population Genetics and Biological Stats Population genetics and genomics in R. Includes a primer on how to use R for population genetics and many common analyses in population genetics and genomics. 4.3 Practical resources How to structure a Bioinformatic Project. My class on How to structure a Bioinformatic Project for the “Programming for Biology” course at the University of Groningen. Bookdown and GitHub Pages. How to create a website like the one you’re seeing right now (it’s easier than you think!). 4.4 Handy Python, Bash, and R snipets. This section collects methods I often use to handle basic programming task. My advice is to practice them until they become second nature. It will save you a lot of time (at least it does to me). Python Good Practices. My personal compilation of useful ways to write common Python operations in a shorter, more efficient, and easier manner. Handy Everyday Bash - Basics. A collection of methods to handle common bash “situations”. Handy Everyday R - Basics. A collection of methods to handle common bash “situations”.
