For the moment, it works as a repository of materials I use in my work and often recommend or discuss with others. As time permits, I will upload further material prepared by myself as well as new resources that may come my way. In addition, there are links to scientific papers and outreach materials that I find relevant. Contact Details: Email: j.e.amaya.romero@rug.nl. GitHub: https://github.com/jorgeamaya.

Most of these resources assume previous exposure to Statistics, Linux, R, and Python, and may not be the most appropriate material for beginners. If you’re a beginner, my advice is to start with Advanced Statistics or The Epidemiologist R Handbook. For a primer on the mathematical intuition and concepts behind statistical methods, that nonetheless is accessible to everybody, I recommend the NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods. 2.1 General material Advanced Statistics. The statistics book of the Advance Statistics course at the University of Notre Dame by Zhiyong Johnny Zhang and Lijuan Peggy Wang. Contrary to what the name seems to indicate, the first chapters of this book are accessible to anyone with little knowledge of statistic or R. A good place to start. NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods. A free online handbook compiled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the US Department of Commerce. It contains an accessible primer on the mathematical intuition behind most statistical tests and definitions of common statistical terminology. There are links to R code to perform the statistical tests described in the book. Tutorials and Workshops on R and statistics. One of my favorite sites. It covers the Frequentist and Bayesian of many common statistical test. StatLect. A sort of Dictionary of Statistical terms. Good to clarify basic questions and familiarize yourself with common Statistical concepts. Introduction to Probability, Statistics, and Random Processes by Hossein Pishro-Nik. 2.2 Experimental Design Comparing Means in R. An online course covering most of what needs to be known about Analyses of Variance for Parametric and Non-parametric scenarios. In other words, ANOVA and all its different flavors… To navigate the website, go to the Lessons sections and pick the topic of interest. STAT 501: Regression Methods. Penn Stat’s Regression Methods course, part of their Master in Applied Statistics. It covers the most relevant topics on Regression, from Simple Linear Regression to Multiple Linear Regression. It also contains a primer on Times Series and other types of Regression like Logistic, Poisson, and Non-Linear Regression. STAT 504: Analysis of Discrete Data. Also from Penn State’s master in Applied Statistics, this course covers methods for the analysis of discrete and categorical data. These are more specialized analyses and biologists are unlikely to find them in their day to day, but it’s still a good resource to keep in store. STAT 501: Regression Methods is a prerequisite to go through this material. Mixed Models with R 2.3 Epidemiology The Epidemiologist R Handbook. A reference handbook with an introduction to R, basic statistics, and useful tools to perform epidemiological data analysis (specifically, from chapter 17 to chapter 28), including Times Series, Outbreak Detection, Epidemic Modelling, Contact Tracing, Survey Analysis, Survival Analysis, and Likert Scales (chapter 33.4). Light on the math side. To get a better grasp of the math behind these methods, check Experimental Design section. Epidemiology and Public Health with R. A curated list of resources for the R programming language on Epidemiology. Compiled by Virgilio Gómez Rubio from University of Castilla-LaMancha. Although the focus of the list rests on epidemiology, many of these resources can be used in Public Health, Biomedical Research, Pharmaceutical Research, Clinical Trials, Genetics Analysis, Medical Imaging Analysis, Meta-Analysis, Pharmacokinetics Analysis and Survival Analysis. Survival Analysis in R. 2.4 Advanced material Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats) and Common statistical tests are linear models: a work through. Excellent resources that prove the power of Regression Methods and how most experimental designs are, at the end of the day, Regressions. Advanced Regression Methods. The syllabus of the Advanced Regression Methods course at the University of Alabama by Cheng Hua, Dr. Youn-Jeng Choi, Qingzhou Shi. This material cover more advanced regression methods not covered in the Penn State courses including Curvilinear Regressions methods, Multi-level models, Growth Models, Binary Logistic Regression, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Ordinal Logistics Regression, and Probit Analysis. Statistics, Data, Science. A site ran Michael Clark that covers Advanced Statistical and Machine Learning methods using R. New material is added sporadically. 2.5 Miscellaneous Power Analysis in R. Effect sizes for ANOVAs. Basics of estimated marginal means. Understanding Q-Q Plots.

Focus is given to materials that have an applied focus rather than a theoretical one. For more theoretical materials, go to the Basic Math section. 3.1 Data Exploration Pandas Profiling. A Python Library that automatizes the production of summary statistics from pandas data frames, similar to the summary() function in R, but with more output. Good for data exploration before running further analysis. Source code is available here. Further examples are here. 3.2 Correlation Methods Calculating and visualizing the correlations in large multidimensional data sets is not trivial. This section explores techniques to calculate correlations. An Alternative to the Correlation Coefficient That Works For Numeric and Categorical Variables. s-Corrplot. The s-CorrPlot is a scatterplot for visually exploring pairwise correlation coefficients between multiple variables in large datasets. Running Correlations in R. A chapter on correlation from the Advanced Regression Methods course from the University of Alabama already mentioned in the Statistics and Experimental Design section. It covers “classical” correlation methods like Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlations, and more niche methods like Point Biserial Correlation, Phi Correlation, and Partial and Semipartial Correlation. 3.3 Clustering Methods Cluster Analysis in R: Practical Guide. A compilation of clustering methods in R that includes some of the conceptual background that underpins them. "],["bioinformatics-workflows.html", "Chapter 4 Bioinformatics Workflows 4.1 Workflows 4.2 Population Genetics and Biological Stats 4.3 Practical resources", " Chapter 4 Bioinformatics Workflows This page compiles some common bioinformatic workflows any person working with NGS is likely to perform at some point. Special focus is given to aligning sequences to a reference genome and doing the variant calling. 4.1 Workflows Variant Calling Workflow - From reads to short variants. RNA-Seq Analyses. Data Wrangling and Processing for Genomics. How to use command-line tools to perform quality control, align reads to a reference genome, and identify and visualize between-sample variation. Part of a more comprehensive workshop on genomics that assumes no previous knowledge of the command line. 4.2 Population Genetics and Biological Stats Population genetics and genomics in R. Includes a primer on how to use R for population genetics and many common analyses in population genetics and genomics. 4.3 Practical resources How to structure a Bioinformatic Project. My class on How to structure a Bioinformatic Project for the “Programming for Biology” course at the University of Groningen. Python Good Practices. My personal compilation of useful ways to write common Python operations in a shorter, more efficient, and easier manner. Bookdown and GitHub Pages. How to create a website like the one you’re seeing right now (it’s easier than you think!). "],["basic-math.html", "Chapter 5 Basic Math", " Chapter 5 Basic Math This section covers some of the basic math that is necessary to understand Machine Learning Algorithms. Paul’s Online Notes. Online notes prepared by Paul Dawkins from Lamar University. The material cover Linear Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus, and Differential Equations. Linear Algebra Cheat Sheet. The Magic of Machine Learning: Gradient Descent Explained Simply but With All Math. Gradient descent is the most common optimization algorithm used in Machine Learning methods, including Neural Networks. Any person wanting to understand and perform ML must have a basic understanding of this algorithm, even if just to choose a different optimization technique. This article covers the math behind the Gradient Descent algorithm without being overwhelming. Some basic understanding of Linear Algebra is necessary.
