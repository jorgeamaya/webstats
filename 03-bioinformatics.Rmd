# Bioinformatics Workflows

This page compiles some common bioinformatic workflows any person working with NGS is like to perform at some point.

* [Variant Calling Workflow - From reads to short variants ](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-ngsintro/2105/lab_vc.html).
* [RNA-Seq Analyses](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-ngsintro/2105/lab_rnaseq.html).

## Practical resources
* [How to structure a Bioinformatic Project](https://github.com/jorgeamaya/webstats/blob/main/docs/_main_files/How_to_structure_a_bioinformatics_project.pdf). My class on How to structure a Bioinformatic Project for the "Programming for Biology" course at the University of Groningen.
