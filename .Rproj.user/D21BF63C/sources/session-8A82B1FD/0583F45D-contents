# About
This site compiles online resources in the areas of Experimental Design, Machine Learning, and Bioinformatics. For the moment, it works as a repository of materials I use in my own work and often recommend or discuss with others. 

In addition, there are links to scientific papers and outreach materials that I find relevant. 

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
